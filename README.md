## Follow-up to questions during the talk

**Q1.** What about the blind spot in the middle of your eye?

**A1.** You do indeed have a blind spot on the optic disc (where the optic nerve connect to the retina), however since most people have stereo-vision (can see with both eyes) this doesn't really affect anything. However, you should be aware of change blindness, also called selective attention. Put simply, change blindness means that you are unaware of other things happening when given a cognitively taxing task. [Here's a video that demonstrates this.](https://youtu.be/IGQmdoK_ZfY)

**Q2.** I thought you had more red cones in your eyes?

**A2.** Indeed you do. 62% of your cones are devoted to seeing the color red compared with 33% for green. However, when combined with Rod sensitivity, Green wavelengths produce nearly double the sensitivity the Red Wavelengths - and nearly quadruple the Blue wavelengths.

**Q3.** All of this information seems to be about static visualizations. What about 3D & interactive visualizations?

**A3.** I'm still looking into where the state-of-the-art is with this type of research. I would recommend "Readings in information visualization : using vision to think" for further information. [I like UW's Interactive Data Lab website also.](http://idl.cs.washington.edu/)
